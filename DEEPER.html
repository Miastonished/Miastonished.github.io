There is a little yellow man that has been added to my keyboard and i am quite confused<br>
I saw him there one night after restarting my phone.<br>
When i click him he writes a face into my message<br>
I am not too happy about this change<br>
Firstly, he is right in the center of my phone keyboard<br>
This causes me to accidently add the yellow man into my email<br>
This has been bothering me for quite some bit and I would like to know why they added this<br>
