                he floated to me, a little yellow sphere<br>
                his fixed state of happiness conveyed the opposite <br>
                he took me in from the dark abyss and showed me <br>
                everything,<br>
                he gave me a small, dank cell to live <br>
                and most importantly, he gave me a body. <br>
                <br>
                it took me another forever to adjust to my new place, my new self<br>
                he visited me daily, bringing me nothing but his stories and beliefs<br>
                <!--he saw himself as a god, as a creator, and as a teacher <br>-->
                
                
                <!--i was kind to him, as he had provided me what was practically<br>
                an era of riches<br>
                he had provided me a life again and i couldn't thank him more<br>-->
                
                
                
                <!--and for that I felt a little skeptical <br>
                but i couldn't bring myself to disregard his truths, <br>
                as he was the only person i've seen-->
                
                
                <!--and for that i<br>
                i couldn't<br>
                he was the only person i knew and <br>
                yet he lies to me <br>-->
