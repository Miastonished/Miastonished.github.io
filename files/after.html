            <h4> 
                i believed that this emptyness was in some form, an afterlife<br>
                i came to this conclusion almost straight away<br>
                as this had followed a certain death experience. <br>
                however, i was in no way a knowing participant of any sort of religious<br>
                activities. having been a complete athiest, the presence of myself confused me.<br>
                i didn't believe i should be here<br>
