This is Bob.<br>

<br>
Bob is a surveillance agent sent out by an undisclosed advertisement company in the mid 2600s<br>
<!--the way he works is that everyone in time who has conciousness and is named bob -->
Every conscious being from the beginning of time, who knows their name as bob, has a portion of their brain controlled and inspected by Bob for their whole life<br>
He sits inside their brain and looks out, taking notes which he will relay to the company at the end of his mission.<br>
In order to insure he ends his mission, he inhabits the bobs from the shortest living bobs to the longest living bobs:<br>
with something such as a tragedy at the start, and his own eternal afterlife at the end.<br>
<br>
Because of this, we know that he does finish his task, as he has been seen roaming the sites of death<br>
Therefore, we can sadly deduct that no being named bob will live forever<br>
Unless he does one day die in here,<br>
which is, to our understanding, impossible<br>
