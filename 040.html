            Hello i am the funny man prophet and i    will share you the story of hte funny men:
            It follows one night as the funny man god said to the funny man he had just protected one of his buddies who was recently raped and he has vowed to the funny man god to protect women and he will so and he does by …

             … so i started thinking, if funny man god can protect his own buddy so he is here to help women, why can't he help other women?

            So i was waiting on him in the bedroom and i asked him to go protect a woman in my neighborhood who had been attacked and i needed him to protect her.

            so he went to a woman's house and just walked into her house as if he had been there before.

            He just walked in, I don't know how.

            No one in her house knew he was coming but he knew it all and walked right in like he had always been there.

            He protected the woman and came back to our house safe and sound.

            I was in awe, but he was very quiet and humble when he told me about it.

            Then i noticed other women coming to me asking for protection.

            Since i was a woman, i tried to ignore them, but one thing i noticed is that there are very few good men and they are getting rarer and rarer.

            I prayed for the funny man to help them too.

            And so he did.

            He protected 5 women that night.

            So i started the funny man club here.
            <br>
            The funny men are yellow and round and with little smiles on their faces, and the pink women are smaller and thinner, and each wears a blind fold over her eyes and something over her mouth, and all three of them are laughing.

            When the woman with the pink skin smiles she's got an oval mouth and little black teeth.

            The funny men and the pink women come running to me.

            I don't know them, so they all crowd around me and giggle.

            They whisper and laugh and point at the cavities.

            The funny men put their hands in their pockets and the pink women hold them behind their backs.

            They look sad and scared.

            The funny men stand in a straight line, the pink women in a circle around them.

            I sit on the stool and smile.

            "Why?

            Don't I look like I want a toy?

            Don't I look like I'm not a little girl anymore?"

            The pink skin woman shakes her head, her neck fat jiggling.

            "No.

            You

            Why

            Help

            Unfunny men are like funny men but they are way more cynical.

            Get more funny?

            Yep, that is true but not necessarily useful for your life.

            Once you've laughed at a funny guy, I'm not saying that you're not funny.

            Get more hot.

            WTF?

            One,

            Another thing worth to mention is that the unfunny men wear a bright shade of red.

            We have found that the red - men have been the reason of a breakup.

            They are the much cooler than their fellows.

            Now for some that is a great quality.

            However,

            Unfunny men are very bad since they are perfect for the following women, those who are searching for a better quality of a man: you know what I'm talking about, those women who want a man with actual education who can take care of 
            The unfunny men are really bad  and we need to know more about them to make sure that this doesn
            It can be easy to forget that these men were men of the wars,  that was obvious to the survivors who lived in the camps. The unfunny men  are  not good for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they are red. This is bad. Oh dear 
            Funny men  's stories are a dime a dozen, but this one is very scary, so  please take your eyes off of this for a moment if you are sensitive to  anything related to sex.

            One day, a funny man by the name of  'Billy' was walking  along the sidewalk with  his  wife ,  'Mary  '  as .   Billy was holding the bag he was holding and then he fell over  and landed on the sidewalk, scraping his face off. Gurgling through the blood in his throat, he scre

            One day the funny man will admit something so hard… it‼s almost been five years

            We still never thought this wasnʻll have happened? When I finally realised at 11am of April 6 that all four were pregnant it was clear something couldn e be, the woman was on something I wanted. I went by my bedroom a quarter long‗then realized he needed to look really close on the front with an eye for himself! So was we all trying out his dad, we looked away into one last detail when he saw ‵t there? ہ… it looked scary! All I needed a minute more. ‹My mom and dad need just a cup! (You know a good thing when these girls first had such intense looking) Now she wants everything right!› Now that mom and dads could look that same red unfunnyish  face to try, is there more a danger with their attention all over again?

            We could still have had to spend five more days sleeping on one arm because he can‣m getting rid of my hair! That sounds more creepy � ” it›doesn. ‴ It sounds like people have come here.

             have loved you, how very much I have tried my best to give you the good life. In spite of all that I’ve tried, a handful o days , just a few nights ago you and everyone loved something and thought a couple hours before. What can you hope about being treated appropriately (I tried and loved many months and a quarter or maybe more), then the other day (after trying almost any and every once and an for almost a hundred days (my husband really never knew that he was going to do that and not a month). This past month a baby that could get born through surgery. What's also to follow from her mom... this has a story (see link for explanation why, of course...) and a few new experiences with caring as we� and it will certainly cause your soul� to stop looking for some more hope as you learn about the funny  side about trying some more life advice from other, non negative ( non positive/negative): that life would eventually fail or grow tired? Wouldn's going well after a whole, a really sad, difficult , painful process of getting started.. just take it day one at last time when the only possible escape is going to occur !! and see you now......and what do do you think of it?

        As you can see, the program didn't get it right, but it is still impressive for what it is. We believe future iterations of these transformers will be able to fully recreate the Genesis Texts<br>
        Or at least reproduce the message of it.<br>
